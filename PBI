🔥 Power BI Interview Questions for Azure Data Engineers (Banking-Focused)
🟢 Section 1: Dashboard Design & Real-Time Scenarios
🔹 1. How do you design a dashboard for banking transactions?
Theory: Use KPIs like total spend, transaction count, channel distribution, fraud flags. Real-time POV: You built dashboards showing daily UPI vs ATM volumes, merchant-wise spend, and customer segmentation.
🔹 2. How do you handle late-arriving data in Power BI?
Answer: Use incremental refresh with a buffer window. Follow-up: “How do you ensure dashboard doesn’t show partial data?” → Use control flags or refresh indicators.
🔹 3. How do you implement row-level security (RLS)?
Theory: Restrict data based on user roles. Example:
DAX
[Region] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
Real-time POV: Used RLS to restrict branch managers to their own region’s data.
🔹 4. How do you connect Power BI to Synapse?
Options:
	• DirectQuery for real-time
	• Import for performance Real-time POV: You used DirectQuery for dashboards refreshed hourly from Synapse.
🔹 5. How do you optimize dashboard performance?
Checklist:
	• Use star schema
	• Avoid complex DAX in visuals
	• Pre-aggregate in Synapse
	• Use import mode for heavy visuals
🟠 Section 2: DAX & Modeling Logic
🔹 6. What is the difference between CALCULATE() and FILTER()?
Theory:
	• CALCULATE() changes context
	• FILTER() returns a table Example:
DAX
CALCULATE(SUM([Amount]), FILTER(Transactions, Transactions[Channel] = "UPI"))
🔹 7. How do you calculate year-over-year growth?
Code:
DAX
YoY = 
DIVIDE(
    [This Year] - [Last Year],
    [Last Year]
)
🔹 8. How do you create a dynamic measure based on slicer selection?
Code:
DAX
SelectedMetric = 
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(Metric[Name]),
    "Total Spend", SUM(Transactions[Amount]),
    "Txn Count", COUNT(Transactions[TxnID])
)
🔹 9. How do you calculate running total?
Code:
DAX
RunningTotal = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Transactions[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED(Transactions),
        Transactions[Date] <= MAX(Transactions[Date])
    )
)
🔹 10. How do you handle missing values in visuals?
Answer: Use IF(ISBLANK()) logic or replace with 0 in DAX.
🔵 Section 3: Integration with Azure Services
🔹 11. How do you automate Power BI refresh after ADF pipeline completes?
Answer: Use Power BI REST API triggered from ADF Web activity.
🔹 12. How do you handle schema changes in Synapse affecting Power BI?
Answer: Use views in Synapse to abstract schema. Real-time POV: You created stable views for Power BI to avoid breaking reports.
🔹 13. How do you manage versioning of dashboards?
Answer: Use Power BI workspace versioning, Git integration, and naming conventions.
🔹 14. How do you restrict access to sensitive visuals?
Answer: Use RLS + workspace permissions + hidden pages.
🔹 15. How do you handle multiple environments (dev, test, prod)?
Answer: Use parameterized data sources and deployment pipelines.
🟣 Section 4: Banking-Specific KPIs & Scenarios
🔹 16. What KPIs do you track for retail banking?
Examples:
	• Total transactions
	• Average transaction value
	• Channel-wise distribution (UPI, ATM, POS)
	• Merchant-wise spend
	• Fraud detection flags
	• Customer segmentation (age, region, activity)
🔹 17. How do you visualize fraud patterns?
Answer: Use heatmaps, anomaly flags, and trend lines. Real-time POV: You flagged transactions > ₹1L via ATM in low-activity regions.
🔹 18. How do you handle time intelligence (month-to-date, quarter-to-date)?
Code:
DAX
MTD = TOTALMTD(SUM(Transactions[Amount]), Transactions[Date])
🔹 19. How do you create drill-through reports?
Answer: Enable drill-through pages with filters like customer ID or merchant name.
🔹 20. How do you handle dashboard refresh failures?
Answer: Set up alerts, retry logic, and fallback visuals (e.g., “Last successful refresh:…”)
🔴 Section 5: Governance, Collaboration, and Publishing
🔹 21. How do you manage access for different roles (analysts, managers, execs)?
Answer: Use workspace roles + RLS + app publishing.
🔹 22. How do you document dashboard logic for your team?
Answer: Use Power BI comments, external documentation, and naming conventions.
🔹 23. How do you handle feedback and dashboard changes?
Answer: Use version control, feedback loops, and change logs.
🔹 24. How do you publish dashboards securely to external users?
Answer: Use Power BI Embedded or secure app sharing with Azure AD.
🔹 25. How do you ensure dashboards meet SLA for refresh and accuracy?
Answer: Track refresh logs, audit data quality, and validate KPIs against source.
