✅ Azure Services Interview Questions (Top 25)
🟢 Section 1: Azure Data Factory (ADF) (1–7)
🔹 1. What is Azure Data Factory (ADF)?
Theory: ADF is a cloud-based ETL/ELT service for orchestrating and automating data pipelines. Real-time POV: Interviewers ask: “How do you schedule and monitor pipelines?” Example:
	• You used ADF to orchestrate ingestion from SQL → ADLS → Synapse.
	• Triggered pipelines daily, logged row counts in control tables.
🔹 2. What are ADF triggers?
Theory: Triggers start pipelines (schedule, tumbling window, event-based). Real-time POV: “How would you handle late-arriving files?” Example: Event trigger on blob storage → pipeline starts when file lands.
🔹 3. What is the difference between Copy Activity and Data Flow?
Theory:
	• Copy Activity → moves data.
	• Data Flow → transforms data at scale. Real-time POV: “When do you use Data Flow vs Databricks?” Answer: Data Flow for light transformations, Databricks for heavy logic.
🔹 4. How do you implement incremental loads in ADF?
Theory: Use watermark columns (last_updated) and control tables. SQL Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE last_updated > '2025-11-01';
Real-time POV: “How do you avoid duplicates?” → Use dedup logic in sink.
🔹 5. How do you handle schema drift in ADF?
Theory: Enable schema drift in Data Flows. Real-time POV: “What if source adds a new column?” → Pipeline won’t break, but you must validate.
🔹 6. How do you monitor ADF pipelines?
Theory: Use Azure Monitor, log analytics, alerts. Real-time POV: “How do you know if a pipeline failed at 2 AM?” → Alerts + email notifications.
