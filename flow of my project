“We’re a 5-member team focused on retail banking pipelines — UPI, ATM, POS, and customer transactions. We ingest from SQL Server, MySQL, and flat files dropped by upstream systems. Other domains like risk and compliance have separate teams, but we collaborate closely on shared infrastructure and governance.”
Our 5-member team in retail banking owns ingestion from digital channels like ATM, UPI, and POS, as well as payment gateways and branch systems. We use ADF and Databricks for real-time and batch ETL. For core banking and CRM systems, we collaborate with upstream teams who provide curated views or files. We also monitor pipeline health using Azure Monitor and Power BI logs.”

What Happens After Getting the Data in Retail Banking ETL
Once your team ingests data from sources like ATM logs, UPI transactions, POS swipes, and branch systems, the next steps are:
✅ 1. Data Cleaning & Standardization
•	Handled by: Your team (ETL engineers)
•	Tools: PySpark in Databricks, ADF Data Flows
•	Tasks:
o	Remove duplicates
o	Handle nulls
o	Standardize formats (e.g., date, currency, channel codes)
o	Apply business rules (e.g., flag suspicious transactions)
✅ 2. Data Modeling (Dimensional Design)
•	Handled by: Often a mix of:
o	Your team (if you’re full-stack data engineers)
o	BI/reporting team (if they own dashboard logic)
o	Data architects (for enterprise-wide consistency)
🔹 What You Might Design:
•	Fact tables: fact_transactions, fact_customer_activity, fact_card_swipes
•	Dimension tables: dim_customer, dim_merchant, dim_channel, dim_time
•	SCD logic: For slowly changing dimensions like customer address
🔹 Tools Used:
•	Synapse SQL
•	Databricks Delta Lake
•	ERD tools (Lucidchart, dbt, or internal modeling tools)
✅ 3. Data Enrichment
•	Handled by: Your team or upstream teams
•	Examples:
o	Join with merchant metadata
o	Add fraud flags
o	Map channel codes to readable names
✅ 4. Data Loading into Warehouse
•	Handled by: Your team
•	Destination: Azure Synapse (Gold layer)
•	Purpose: Power BI dashboards, executive reporting, analytics
✅ 5. Governance & Access Control
•	Handled by: Data governance team + your team
•	Tasks:
o	Mask PII
o	Apply RBAC
o	Track lineage
o	Audit logs
✅ 6. Dashboard Consumption
•	Handled by: BI/reporting team
•	Tools: Power BI, Tableau
•	Data Source: Synapse views or import mode from Gold layer
🧠 Interview-Ready Answer
“After ingesting data from retail banking sources like ATM, UPI, and POS, our team cleans and standardizes it using PySpark and ADF. We design dimensional models — fact and dimension tables — in Synapse, often collaborating with BI and data architecture teams. We enrich the data, apply SCD logic, and load it into the Gold layer for Power BI dashboards. Governance teams help with masking and access control, ensuring compliance and audit readiness.”
•	ETL + modeling for Synapse or Delta Lake
•	Designing fact tables for transactions, customer activity, merchant spend
•	Creating dimension tables for time, channel, customer, merchant
•	Implementing SCD Type 2 for slowly changing dimensions
🧩 What You’re Expected to Model
In your retail banking context, you’d likely design:
Table Type	Examples
Fact Tables	fact_transactions, fact_card_swipes, fact_customer_activity
Dimension Tables	dim_customer, dim_channel, dim_merchant, dim_time
Bridge Tables	For many-to-many relationships (e.g., customer-product)
Audit Tables	etl_audit_log, pipeline_control_table
Your Data Modeling Responsibilities (Mapped to Owned Sources)
✅ 1. Digital Banking Channels

o	dim_time (for time-based slicing)
•	Apply SCD Type 2 for customer or channel metadata changes
•	Define aggregations for KPIs: txn count, avg value, failure rate
🔹 Example:
sql
CREATE TABLE fact_digital_transactions (
  txn_id STRING,
  customer_id STRING,
  channel STRING,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  txn_status STRING,
  txn_timestamp DATETIME,
