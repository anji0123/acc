Data Warehousing Interview Questions (Theory + SQL/PySpark Examples)
🔹 1. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?
Theory:
	• OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Handles day-to-day transactions (banking, retail). Optimized for inserts/updates.
	• OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Handles reporting and analytics. Optimized for queries and aggregations.
Example:
	• OLTP → Banking system recording deposits/withdrawals.
	• OLAP → Dashboard showing monthly transaction trends.
🔹 2. What is a Data Warehouse?
Theory: A centralized repository for structured, historical data used for reporting and analytics. It integrates data from multiple sources (ERP, CRM, logs).
SQL Example (fact table):
sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  sale_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
🔹 3. What are Fact and Dimension tables?
Theory:
	• Fact table: Contains measurable metrics (sales, transactions).
	• Dimension table: Contains descriptive attributes (customer, product, time).
SQL Example:
sql
-- Dimension
CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  city VARCHAR(50)
);
-- Fact
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES dim_customer(customer_id)
);
🔹 4. What are Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)?
Theory: Dimensions change over time (e.g., customer address).
	• Type 1: Overwrite old data.
	• Type 2: Add new row with effective dates.
	• Type 3: Add new column for previous value.
SQL Example (SCD Type 2):
sql
INSERT INTO dim_customer (customer_id, name, address, effective_date, end_date)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'New Address', CURRENT_DATE, '9999-12-31');
UPDATE dim_customer
SET end_date = CURRENT_DATE
WHERE customer_id = 101 AND end_date = '9999-12-31';
🔹 5. What is a Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema?
Theory:
	• Star Schema: Fact table in center, dimensions around it. Simple, fast.
	• Snowflake Schema: Dimensions normalized into sub-dimensions. More complex, saves space.
Diagram POV:
	• Star → fact_sales → dim_customer, dim_product, dim_time.
	• Snowflake → dim_customer → dim_city → dim_country.
🔹 6. What is a Data Mart?
Theory: Subset of a data warehouse focused on a specific business area (e.g., Sales, HR). Helps faster reporting for departments.
🔹 7. What is ETL vs ELT?
Theory:
	• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Transform before loading into warehouse.
	• ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): Load raw data first, then transform inside warehouse (common in cloud DW like Snowflake, BigQuery).
🔹 8. What is a Control Table in ETL?
Theory: Tracks pipeline runs, last load time, row counts, errors. Used for incremental loads.
SQL Example:
sql
CREATE TABLE control_table (
  pipeline_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_run_time TIMESTAMP,
  row_count INT
);
🔹 9. What is Data Partitioning?
Theory: Splitting large tables into smaller chunks (by date, region) for performance.
SQL Example:
sql
CREATE TABLE transactions PARTITION BY RANGE (txn_date);
🔹 10. What is Data Governance in Warehousing?
Theory: Ensures data quality, security, lineage, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA). Includes metadata management and access control.

sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer ON fact_sales(customer_id);
🔹 17. What is Materialized View?
Theory: Stores query results physically for faster access.

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS total
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY month;
🔹 18. What is Data Governance?
Theory: Ensures data quality, security, lineage, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA). Includes metadata management and access control.
🔹 19. What is Data Quality in Warehousing?
Theory: Ensuring accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness. Checks: nulls, duplicates, schema drift.
SQL Example:
sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact_sales WHERE amount < 0 OR customer_id IS NULL;
🔹 20. What is Data Archiving?
Theory: Moving old data to cheaper storage while keeping recent data in warehouse. Improves performance and reduces cost.
🔹 21. What is a Cube in OLAP?
Theory: Multi-dimensional structure for fast aggregations (sales by product, region, time).
🔹 22. What is Granularity in Fact Tables?
Theory: Level of detail stored (transaction-level vs daily summary). Lower granularity = more detail, higher storage.
🔹 23. What is Schema Drift?
Theory: Unexpected changes in source schema (new columns, type changes). Handled with schema validation or dynamic ingestion.
🔹 24. What is Idempotent ETL?
Theory: ETL that can run multiple times without duplicating data. Implemented using MERGE or deduplication logic.
🔹 25. What is Incremental Load?
Theory: Loading only new/changed data since last run. Implemented using last_updated column or CDC (Change Data Capture).
SQL Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales WHERE last_updated > '2025-11-01';
